  <h3 class="my-2">Important Notes</h3>

  <strong class="font-bold text-red-700">High Voltage Safety</strong>: Exercise extreme caution when working with high voltage. If you are unsure about any steps, consult a professional technician. <br />
  <strong class="font-bold text-red-700">Follow Local Codes</strong>: Ensure that your work adheres to local electrical codes and standards. <br />
  <strong class="font-bold text-red-700">Documentation</strong>: Keep a record of your wiring setup for future reference and troubleshooting.

</div>

### Preparation

**Safety First!**
Unplug your machine to ensure there's no live connections while working on it.
Work in a dry environment to prevent electrical hazards.

Read through the entire guide first to make sure any questions will be cleared before the installation. You can always contact us for help or open a help thread on our [Discord](https://discord.gaggimate.eu/).

Prepare all parts, materils and tools listed in the sourcing pages. Follow these guides if you haven't already: [Printed Parts](/docs/sourcing-printed-parts) and [Flashing](/docs/flashing).

Check the [Pinout](/docs/pinout) and prepare the [wires](/docs/wiring) if you didn't buy the kit.
We recommend downloading and/or printing the [Classic Wiring](/downloads/GaggiMate_cl_wiring_curves.pdf) and
[Classing Wiring Schematics](/downloads/Classic-Wiring.pdf) PDFs.
This guide is referencing them.

#### Check all the parts
Check that you have all the parts ready to go. All parts needed are in the full kit (standard or pro).

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_01} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_02} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

#### NOTE: if your machine has faulty parts (switches, pump, solenoid valve, ...) the GaggiMate will not magically heal it!
(* that does not apply to blown thermostats, since they will be replaced)

#### Check the screen

<Preview src={ribbon} width={400} alt="" />

Before you assemble the screen, check that the ribbon is seated and locked correctly like in this picture. If it isn't for any reason,
unlock the connector by pulling down the black locking tab horizontally to the board, insert the cable and close it back up.
Check for an image by plugging it into a USB connection before you continue.

#### Assemble the printed parts

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_03} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_04} width={400} alt="" />
</div>
Take the screen out of the box and try to glue it as straight and centered as possible. Place it in the base and close with the cover.

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_05} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_06} width={400} alt="" />
</div>
Place the PCB in the pcb cover at an angle to guide the USB-C port in the cutout. Afterwards push it down to lock it in the base. Make sure you've already flashed it before as you might need to access the boot button to do so.

### Machine preparation

#### Disassemble the machine


<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_07} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_08} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_09} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

Remove all parts from the machine that could bother you during the installation or fall out like the water lid, drip tray and portafilter. Remove the two screws marked above in the picture.<br />
This allows you to remove the cupwarmer. Unplug the grounding wire on the flip side of the warmer. Remember to connect it again when re-assembling!

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_09_2} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_10} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_11} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

Make yourself familiar with the guts of the machine. Remember: we are working on a Gaggia Classic (NOT Gaggia Classic Pro / E24 / Evo).

#### Making room by moving the switches

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_12} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_13} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_14} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

Prey the rectangular clamp around the switches open and move it a little towards the inside of the machine. We will remove it later

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_15} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_16} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_17} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

Find the flat metal spring on bot sides of the switches section that hold it in place.
Squeeze it and then move the whole section out of the housing. It is easier if you work on one side first and then move to the other.

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_18} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_19} width={400} alt="" />
</div>


Now you can easily Remove the clamp. It is cut on the bottom so you can lead the wires through.
Tilt the switches section as shown above.

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_20} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_21} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

Compare your stock wiring with the [Classing Wiring Schematics](/downloads/Classic-Wiring.pdf). In case something, i.e. your wire coloring, differs from the PDF, you should be able to understand and adapt the guide to your indvidual machine.
##The next steps will follow steps 1 through 9 of the PDF.


#### OPTIONAL / RECOMMENDED

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_21} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_22} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_23} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

We recommend making mor room in order to more easily access the parts and wires:
- With an allen key: unscrew the 4 screws that hold the boiler
- Unscrew and remove the steam wand
- Do not forget the gascet

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">

</div>

- Remove the steam knob by pulling it firmly #make sure you do not loose the metal spring inside the knob.
- Remove the heat protection disc by also pulling it off.

<div className="flex flex-row gap-4">
  <Preview src={img_27} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_28} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_29} width={400} alt="" />
  <Preview src={img_30} width={400} alt="" />
</div>

- Find the black overpressure hose on the 3 way solenoid.
- Use pliers to loosen the clamp and move it up the hose.
- Remove the hose from the solenoid.

Make sure the loose wires are fully inserted and cannot be pulled out.
Your Gaggimate controller should look like the last picture above when done.


### Pressure test

Before you close up the machine you'll want to run a pressure test of the system to catch any leaks. For this you can simply run the water mode for a while and see if anything needs fixing.

### Double-Check All Connections
Review all your labeled connections for accuracy and completeness.
Ensure that there are no exposed wires and that all connections are secure and insulated.

Once you have completed that step, test your wiring for possible shorts with a multimeter and make sure you haven't connected any LV connections with HV connections. Also test the switches operation for continuity in the different switch positions.

### Testing
Now is the big moment. Turn on your machine for the first time. The heater should not be heating on power-on and nothing else should be running. You can check if the heater is doing anything by observing the LED on the SSR.
The screen should turn on and show the Standby screen of GaggiMate. Touch the screen once to switch to warmup mode, you should see the current room temperature being displayed and the LED on the SSR will light up indicating it's heating up. Check that nothing is leaking inside of the machine.

### Final Steps
Reassemble the Machine: Carefully put the panels back on, ensuring that there are no pinched wires. <br />
Conduct a Safety Check: Perform a final inspection to ensure everything is insulated and that there are no exposed wiring connections.

If you have any further questions or need additional clarifications, feel free to go into the Discord and make a help thread or post on our Subreddit.

### Congratulations

You have now finished setting up your Gaggia Classic Pro with GaggiMate and can start making coffee. To check more tasks on your first startup go to [First Start](/docs/usage-first-start). If you encounter any problems during the installation check our [Troubleshooting guide](/pages/troubleshooting) or open a help thread in #gaggimate-help on [Discord](https://discord.gaggimate.eu/).
